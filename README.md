<h1>🚗 Toyota Car Price Prediction</h1>

<h2>📖 Introduction</h2>
<p>
This project focuses on predicting the <b>selling price of Toyota cars</b> based on various features such as year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and more. 
It uses <b>Machine Learning regression models</b> to forecast car prices and help users, dealers, and businesses make data-driven decisions.
</p>

<p>The project includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
  <li>Feature selection and engineering</li>
  <li>Model training using regression algorithms</li>
  <li>Evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² score</li>
  <li>Deployment for interactive predictions (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>🎯 Project Objective</h2>
<p>
The main goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict car prices. This helps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Car buyers and sellers understand fair market pricing</li>
  <li>Dealerships optimize pricing strategies</li>
  <li>Insurance and finance companies assess vehicle value for loans and coverage</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>🧪 Model Evaluation</h2>
<p>Example evaluation metrics for the trained model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 1500.25</li>
  <li>MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 1200.50</li>
  <li>R² Score: 0.89</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>📊 Final Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Polynomial Regression:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>R² Score: 0.95</li>
      <li>Interpretation: Approximately 95% of the variance in car prices is explained by the predictors, indicating a strong relationship between the features and car prices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Multiple Linear Regression:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>R² Score: 0.93</li>
      <li>Interpretation: Approximately 93% of the variance in car prices is explained by the predictors, indicating a strong relationship between the features and car prices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Decision Tree Regression:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>R² Score: 0.94</li>
      <li>Interpretation: Around 94% of the variance in car prices is explained by the predictors, suggesting a strong relationship, slightly better than multiple linear regression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Random Forest Regression:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>R² Score: 0.96</li>
      <li>Interpretation: 96% of the variance in car prices is explained by the predictors, showing the strongest relationship among all the models tested.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Overall Conclusion:</b> Best Model: <b>Random Forest Regression</b>, as it achieved the highest R² score (0.96), indicating that it best captures the variance in car prices among the models applied.</p>

<h2>💡 Future Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>⚡ <b>Advanced Regression Models</b>: Try Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or CatBoost for better performance</li>
  <li>📈 <b>Hyperparameter Tuning</b>: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters</li>
  <li>🧪 <b>Feature Expansion</b>: Incorporate additional features like car condition, owner history, and location</li>
  <li>🌐 <b>Deployment</b>: Build a web app using Streamlit or Flask for interactive price prediction</li>
  <li>📱 <b>Mobile App</b>: Lightweight mobile integration for users to predict car prices on the go</li>
</ul>
